## New roguelike game
Creating a game on my own without a tutorial since I'm having trouble getting libtcod to work with C++.

## TODO
Make a better Makefile, need to handle building on other systems and building on windows

[X]step 1, render a font as tiles. I think I want to use the [BlexMono nerd font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.4.0/IBMPlexMono.zip).

[X] Create class for the game engine
    [] load assets
    [] initialize
    [] update game state
    [] render game state
    [] handle input
[X] Create entity class
[] Create state machine
